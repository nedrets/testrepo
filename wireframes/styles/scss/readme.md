This folder will contain the main source ```.scss``` files.

Use the _"vendor"_ subfolder for third-party ```.scss``` files and the _"yourclientname"_ subfolder for client-specific source ```.scss``` files.

### Pro Tips:
- Use [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/index.html) to automatically create the _"yourclientname.css"_ from your _"yourclientname.scss"_ file located in this folder.
- See [CodeKit's Sass Documentation](https://incident57.com/codekit/help.html#sass) for some nifty settings to improve working with ```.scss``` files.
