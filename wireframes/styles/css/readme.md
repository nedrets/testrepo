This folder will contain compiled ```.css``` files only!. Use the _"vendor"_ subfolder for third-party ```.css```.

### Pro Tips:
- [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/index.html) will automatically create the _"yourclientname.css"_ from your _"yourclientname.scss"_ file located in the ```styles > scss``` folder.
- See [CodeKit's Sass Documentation](https://incident57.com/codekit/help.html#sass) for some nifty settings to improve working with ```.scss``` files.
