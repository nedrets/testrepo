This folder holds the folder/file structure for your _Wireframes_

### Process:
1. Work within this _"Wireframes"_ folder for all _"Gray-box Wire"_ work.
2. Once _"Gray-box Wires"_ are approved...
    1. Add a _"Wireframes-Approved"_ tag to the Github Repo. See [working with tags](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-tags/).
    2. Duplicate this _"Wireframes"_ folder and rename:  _"Designs"_
    3. So you should now have two folders: _"Wireframes"_ and _"Designs"_
3. You should now continue *all* future work within the new _"Designs"_ folder only!

### Pro Tips:
- Be sure to update your repo's root level ```index.html``` file with any links to newly created pages within the _"Designs"_ folder.
