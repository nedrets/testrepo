This folder contains all of your ```.html``` templates.
Please keep a 1:1 ratio of ```.html``` files to page types, if possible.

### Pro Tips:
- If you have [Emmet installed](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)... type "!" and hit the ```tab``` key to set up a simple dummy ```.html``` page.
    - You can adjust what key expands an Emmet abbreviation by adjusting the package settings under ```Atom > Preferences > Packages > Emmet > Settings```
- When using [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/index.html) why not consider using a simple ```*.kit``` includes in an _"includes"_ subfolder for "global" elements like navigation and footers? More info about ```*.kit``` includes and other CodeKit topics [here](https://incident57.com/codekit/help.html#kit).
